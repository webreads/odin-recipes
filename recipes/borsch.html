    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Borsch is a beloved and hearty Eastern European soup, often associated with Ukraine, though it’s enjoyed in many countries across the region. This rich, flavorful dish is made from a base of beets, which give it a signature deep red color and earthy sweetness. The soup typically includes a variety of vegetables such as carrots, potatoes, cabbage, and onions, all simmered together in a savory broth. The addition of tomatoes or tomato paste adds a tangy complexity to the flavor profile, while a touch of vinegar and sugar helps to balance the sweetness of the beets and bring out the soup's full depth.</p>
    <p>Traditionally, borsch is served hot with a generous dollop of sour cream, which complements the soup’s rich flavors and adds a creamy texture. Fresh dill is often sprinkled on top as a garnish, providing a bright and aromatic finish. Some variations include meat such as beef, pork, or chicken, while others opt for a vegetarian version. Whether enjoyed on a cold winter day or as a celebratory dish, borsch is more than just a meal—it's a warm, comforting experience that brings people together around the table.</p>

    <h2>Cooking</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil 1-2 lbs of meat (beef, pork, or chicken) with a bay leaf in a pot of water until tender. Skim off any foam. Remove the meat and set aside. Use the broth as the soup base.</li>
        <li>Peel and cube 3 medium potatoes. Add them to the broth and cook over medium heat until tender.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tbsp of sunflower oil in a skillet. Sauté 1 diced onion and 2 grated carrots until soft.</li>
        <li>Add 3 grated beets to the skillet. Stir in 2 tbsp of tomato paste (or 2 chopped tomatoes) and cook for 5 minutes. Add 1-2 tsp of sugar and a splash of vinegar or lemon juice to preserve the beet's bright color.</li>
        <li>Shred 2 cups of cabbage and add it to the pot with the broth and potatoes. Cook for 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer the sautéed vegetables (onion, carrot, beet mixture) to the pot. Stir well and season with salt, pepper, and 1-2 bay leaves. Simmer for 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Optional: Add 1 can of drained beans (kidney or white beans) to the pot for extra protein.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, remove the pot from heat. Let the borsch sit for 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with a dollop of sour cream and garnish with fresh dill. Pair with rye bread or garlic rolls for a traditional touch.</li>
